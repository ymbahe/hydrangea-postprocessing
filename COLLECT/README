This directory contains scripts that collect data from multiple source files
and/or snapshots. They may also do some small data computations (such as
interpolating over gaps).

*** Individual files ***
************************ 

---------
add_fp.py
---------

Add on the forward-projected maximum subhalo and stellar masses to
the FullGalaxyTables catalogues.


-------------------
add_hostDistance.py
-------------------

Add the distance to the nearest 'host' neighbour galaxy to the 
FullGalaxyTables catalogues. This refers to the (Subfind) central for
satellites, and to the nearest FOF group with greater M200c for centrals.


-----------
add_shmr.py
-----------

Add the stellar half mass radius (in 3D) to the FullGalaxyTables.


-------------------
add_spectre_flag.py
-------------------

Add a pointer to spectre parents, and (optionally) a flag telling whether a
galaxy is a spectre, to the 'Full' group in FullGalaxyTables.


----------------------------
add_velocity_to_positions.py
----------------------------

Extract the velocity of all subhaloes in each snap from the subfind catalogue
(Subhalo/Velocity), align it to galaxy IDs. For subhaloes that are not alive
in a given snapshot, velocities are taken from the corresponding GalaxyPaths
table. Where even this fails, velocity gaps are interpolated over using cubic
spline fitting (if there are at least four good snapshots per galaxy), or
linear fitting if there are at least two. 

The output is added to the GalaxyPositionsSnap.hdf5 file, in data set
'Velocity'.


-----------------------
compare_subfind_monk.py
-----------------------

Extract a comparison catalogue of matched galaxy properties between Subfind
and MONK subhaloes.


-----------------------------
collect_extra_subhalo_info.py
-----------------------------

Collect various post-processing outputs in one file
(highlev/SubhaloExtra.hdf5). This includes HYDRO <--> DM subhalo matches,
boundary flags, close pair info, re-computed BH info, and spectre info.


-----------------------
extract_bh_evolution.py
-----------------------

Extract and combine BH data (including from recomputation) across different
snapshots. The result is stored in [freya]/highlev/GalaxyBHTablesMay18.hdf5.


--------------------------------
extract_full_galaxy_catalogue.py
--------------------------------

Extract a combined evolution catalogue across all simulations. Used to be
called `extract_galaxy_growth_[date].py'. 
!! Should be checked for possible need to clean/tidy up and include comments. !!


--------------------
extract_positions.py
--------------------

Extract the positions of all subhaloes in each snap from the subfind catalogue
(Subhalo/CentreOfPotential), converted to proper Mpc and aligned to galaxy
IDs.

For subhaloes that are not alive in a given snapshot, velocities are taken
from the corresponding GalaxyPaths table. Where even this fails, velocity gaps
are interpolated over using cubic spline fitting (if there are at least four
good snapshots per galaxy), or linear fitting if there are at least two.
 
The output is added to the GalaxyPositionsSnap.hdf5 file, in data set
'Centre'.


---------------------------
extract_galaxy_evolution.py
---------------------------

Extract the most frequently used properties of galaxies from all snapshots,
and store them in a single HDF5 file aligned by galaxy ID. Also compute peak
quantities along entire history.
