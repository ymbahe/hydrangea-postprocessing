This directory contains post-processing codes that are, at least in principle,
suitable for both Hydrangea and other Eagle-like simulations.

***********************
*** Subdirectories: ***
***********************

CODE: Contains the source codes (mostly C/C++) for post-processing programs.

COLLECT: Scripts that collect data from multiple source files and/or
snapshots. They may also do some small data computations (such as
interpolating over gaps).

COMPUTE: Scripts that compute additional galaxy (or particle) properties,
beyond what is provided by Subfind. This also includes re-computations of
properties that are affected by bugs in Subfind.  

EAGLE: Contains parameter files/logs/submission scripts for EAGLE-specific
post-processing runs.

HYDRANGEA: Contains parameter files/logs/submission scripts for
Hydrangea-specific post-processing runs. As of 8-May-2019, this also still
contains some actual python program scripts, but these will be moved here in
the long term.

OLD: Previous versions of some of the programs, kept only in case they may be
needed for reference at some point in the future.

STRUCTURE_OUTPUTS: Scripts to catalogue and align outputs from individual
simulations, in particular snipshots.

For further details on their contents, see the individual README files in the
subdirectories.
